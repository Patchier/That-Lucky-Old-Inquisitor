# That-Lucky-Old-Inquisitor

July 1st, 2021 - Full Install: ~125MB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with the last few finishing steps necessary to enjoy That Lucky Old Inquisitor, and with it, the full Patchy Age experience!

## SPECIFICATIONS

- This will not be a very robust readme, as there are very few directions that must be followed.

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL copy of Dragon Age: Inquisition. This list works with both Steam and Origin copies, and you will need ALL DLCs.

## Install Dragon Age: Inquisition

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Dragon Age Inquisition). 

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and set any graphics settings you wish. The only required one is that Mesh quality MUST be set to "Ultra".

Install That Lucky Old Inquisitor via Wabbajack
------------------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modlists". 

3.  From there, you will download "That Lucky Old Inquisitor" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/That Lucky Old Inquisitor", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Dragon Age Inquisition folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the modlist, navigate to your That Lucky Old Inquisitor installation folder. Within it, you will want to open "FrostyModManager.exe". The mods I've chosen should be on the right hand side. It will ask you to navigate to your Dragon Age: Inquisiton executable, which will be in the installation folder for the game. IMPORTANT: For now, it is likely the mods will not automatically apply once you set your game path. As such, select all mods on the lefthand side (shift+click will work), and click "Apply". Once done, click "Launch". (If you are not prompted upon opening the mod manager, you may be prompted after clicking "Launch")
